# LogiTrack Driver Mobile App

Minimal viable React Native driver app for logistics operations testing.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Driver Authentication** - Secure login with driver ID and PIN
- **Job Management** - View assigned routes, start/complete jobs
- **Real-time Location Tracking** - GPS tracking with battery optimization
- **Delivery Management** - Mark deliveries as completed, report issues
- **Offline Support** - Queue actions when network is unavailable
- **Socket.io Integration** - Real-time communication with dispatch

### Screens
1. **LoginScreen** - Driver authentication with demo credentials
2. **JobListScreen** - List of assigned jobs with real-time updates
3. **ActiveJobScreen** - Active job management with delivery tracking

### Services
- **LocationService** - GPS tracking with accuracy optimization
- **DriverService** - API integration and offline support

## Demo Credentials

### Test Drivers
- Driver ID: `DEMO001`, PIN: `1234` (Demo Driver)
- Driver ID: `DRV001`, PIN: `1111` (John Martinez)
- Driver ID: `DRV002`, PIN: `2222` (Sarah Johnson)
- Driver ID: `DRV003`, PIN: `3333` (Mike Chen)
- Driver ID: `DRV004`, PIN: `4444` (Emma Rodriguez)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Xcode (for iOS)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# iOS specific (if developing for iOS)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Android - ensure Android SDK is configured
```

### Development
```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS
npm run ios
```

### Building
```bash
# Build Android APK
npm run build:android

# Build iOS archive
npm run build:ios
```

## Testing Scenarios

### E2E Testing Workflows

#### 1. Driver Login Flow
- Launch app
- Enter demo credentials (DEMO001 / 1234)
- Verify navigation to job list
- Test logout functionality

#### 2. Job Management Flow
- Login as driver
- View assigned jobs list
- Start a pending job
- Verify location tracking activation
- Navigate through delivery stops
- Complete deliveries
- Finish entire job

#### 3. Real-time Updates
- Login on multiple devices with different drivers
- Observe real-time job assignments
- Test Socket.io communication
- Verify location updates

#### 4. Offline Support
- Start job while online
- Disconnect network
- Complete deliveries offline
- Reconnect and verify sync

#### 5. Error Handling
- Test invalid login credentials
- Test network errors
- Test location permission denial
- Test GPS unavailability

### Key Features
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **React Navigation** - Screen navigation with stack navigator
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data persistence
- **Socket.io** - Real-time communication
- **Geolocation** - GPS tracking with accuracy optimization
- **Offline Queue** - Store actions when network unavailable

## Integration Points

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/drivers/login` - Driver authentication
- `GET /api/drivers/jobs` - Get assigned jobs
- `GET /api/drivers/jobs/:id` - Get job details
- `POST /api/drivers/jobs/:id/start` - Start job
- `POST /api/drivers/jobs/:id/complete` - Complete job
- `POST /api/drivers/location` - Location updates

### Socket.io Events
- `job:assigned` - New job assigned to driver
- `job:updated` - Job status changes
- `message` - Dispatch messages
- `location:update` - Driver location updates

## Performance Optimizations

### Location Tracking
- Battery-aware accuracy switching
- Intelligent interval adjustment
- Offline queue management
- Background location optimization

### Network Efficiency
- Request batching
- Offline queue with retry logic
- Optimistic UI updates
- Connection status monitoring

### Memory Management
- Component cleanup on unmount
- Event listener removal
- Socket connection management
- Efficient re-rendering

## Security Considerations

- Secure token storage with AsyncStorage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Network request timeout handling
- Location data encryption in transit
- Driver authentication with PIN codes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Push notifications for new jobs
- Camera integration for delivery proof
- Signature capture for deliveries
- Route optimization suggestions
- Driver performance analytics
- Multi-language support

### Integration Opportunities
- Fleet management systems
- Customer notification APIs
- Payment processing
- Fuel tracking systems
- Maintenance scheduling

This MVP provides a solid foundation for testing core logistics operations while maintaining the flexibility to expand functionality based on operational needs.
